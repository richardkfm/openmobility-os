## [Unreleased]

### Added (Phase 9 — Public Transit Network as a First-Class Layer)
- Full `GTFSConnector` (`gtfs`) — reads a static GTFS zip (stops, routes,
  trips, stop_times, calendar, shapes) and emits one of three normalized
  layers depending on the `layer` config field:
  - `transit_stops` — stops enriched with `wheelchair_boarding`
    (yes/no/unknown), `modes` (bus/tram/rail/subway/…), `daily_trips`,
    `avg_headway_min`, and `night_service` (any trip 22:00–05:00)
  - `transit_routes` — LineString per route, using `shapes.txt` when
    available and falling back to the stop sequence otherwise
  - `transit_coverage` — buffer polygons (default 400 m, configurable via
    `coverage_buffer_m`) around every active stop for catchment analysis
- Optional `agency_filter` and `route_type_filter` config fields restrict the
  output to a specific agency or to selected GTFS route types
- New layer kind `transit_coverage` added to `DataSource.LayerKind`
- New measure categories: `transit_frequency`, `transit_accessibility`,
  `transit_gap` (the existing coverage rule now files under `transit_gap`)
- Two new measure rules:
  - `rule_transit_frequency` — flags workspaces where ≥25 % of stops have an
    average daytime headway above 20 min
  - `rule_transit_accessibility` — flags workspaces where ≥20 % of rated stops
    are not wheelchair-accessible
- Workspace dashboard now shows a "Public transit" KPI strip when transit
  data is present: stop count, average headway (min), population coverage %
  (with absolute resident estimate), night-service share, and barrier-free
  share
- `/api/v1/workspaces/<slug>/` now returns a `transit_kpis` object with the
  same numbers, so dashboards consuming the API can re-render the strip
- Map: `transit_routes` rendered as blue lines, `transit_coverage` as
  translucent buffer polygons; both layers honour the existing layer toggle

### Added (Phase 8 — Accidents as a First-Class Layer, complete)
### Fixed
- Workspace map view now sets `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  on its response. Django's project-wide default of `same-origin` strips the
  `Referer` header from cross-origin tile requests, which the OpenStreetMap
  volunteer tile servers reject with an "access blocked" tile (per their
  [tile usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/)).
  Sending the origin (no path or query) on cross-origin requests satisfies the
  check without leaking the workspace URL to the tile provider.
- Workspace map page now renders correctly under non-English locales (e.g. German).
  Map center coordinates and default zoom embedded in the inline `<script>` are now
  passed through Django's `unlocalize` filter, so floats like `12.3731` are no longer
  formatted as `12,3731` — which previously produced a JavaScript `SyntaxError`
  (`const CENTER_LON = 12,3731;`) and prevented MapLibre from initializing, leaving
  `/<workspace>/map/` blank.
- `OSMOverpassConnector` now sends a descriptive `User-Agent` header
  (`OpenMobilityOS/<version> (+<repo-url>)`) and an explicit `Accept: application/json`
  header when calling the Overpass API. The public Overpass endpoint rejects requests
  with the default `python-requests` User-Agent with `HTTP 406 Not Acceptable`,
  which broke all OSM dataset syncs.

### Added (Phase 8 — Accidents as a First-Class Layer)
- `UnfallatlasConnector` (`unfallat`) — reads German Destatis Unfallatlas CSV format
  (semicolon-delimited, UKATEGORIE severity key, XGCSWGS84/YGCSWGS84 coordinates) and
  normalizes to the standard accident schema
- `AccidentCSVConnector` (`accident_csv`) — generic international accident CSV importer
  with freely configurable column mapping for severity, involved modes, date, and coordinates
- Standard accident property schema enforced by both connectors:
  `severity` (fatal/serious/minor), `date`, `time_of_day`, `weather`, `involved_modes`,
  `vulnerable_road_user`, `speed_limit`, `intersection_type`
- Map: accident layer rendered with severity-coded circle markers
  (dark red = fatal, orange = serious, yellow = minor) using MapLibre GL JS paint expressions
- Map: accident filter panel — filter visible accidents by severity level and involved mode
  (cyclist, pedestrian, car, truck) without a page reload
- Extended `accident_hotspot` measure rule: weighted severity scoring (fatal×3, serious×2,
  minor×1); generates a second VRU-specific measure candidate when ≥3 accidents involve
  cyclists or pedestrians
- Map: heatmap density view for the accidents layer with severity-weighted intensity
  (fatal=1×, serious=0.67×, minor=0.33×) and a yellow→orange→dark-red colour ramp;
  toggled via a Circles/Heatmap segmented control in the accident filter panel

### Added
- Version badge in the public footer and on `/about/` now links directly to the matching GitHub release (`…/releases/tag/v<version>`); footer also gains a persistent "GitHub" link to the source repository
- Django admin screens now display the OpenMobility OS version below the branding, linked to the matching GitHub release, plus a "Source on GitHub" shortcut and the current deployment mode
- `PROJECT_REPO_URL` setting (overridable via `.env`) exposes the canonical source repository URL to templates and the public meta API
- `/api/v1/meta/` now returns `repo_url` and `release_url` so downstream dashboards can link back to the running version's source

### Changed
- Django admin: localized site title and header ("OpenMobility OS · Administration") replace the default "Django administration" chrome
- `README` quickstart: automatic `SECRET_KEY` and `ADMIN_TOKEN` generation via Python one-liner
- `README`: expanded step-by-step setup guide for novice users (Docker installation, each step explained)
- Extracted a shared `core.utils.get_active_workspace` helper; `datasets`, `workspaces`, `measures`, `maps`, and `api` views now use it instead of each app maintaining its own copy of the lookup
- Simplified the scoring strategy override logic into a single `STRATEGY_OVERRIDES` dict instead of an if/if/if chain
- Hardcoded GitHub URL removed from the `/about/` self-hosting snippet — it now interpolates `PROJECT_REPO_URL` so forks and mirrors render the correct clone command

### Fixed
- Stray `>>` characters after the global stylesheet `<link>` in the base template (visible as duplicate markup in some browsers)
- Workspace wizard form: labels now use `for=` bindings to their inputs, and static placeholder examples (`"DE"`, `"Europe/Berlin"`, bounding-box coordinates) are either translated or wrapped in `{% trans %}` so they stay city-agnostic in every locale
- Data source detail screen: action buttons (test, sync, delete) now carry `aria-label`s, explicit `type="submit"`/`"button"`, and visible focus rings; result + spinner regions use `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` for screen readers
- `README`: replaced ASCII header logo that rendered as "SMOS" with a correct "OMOS" wordmark
- Custom domains now work: `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` are both configurable via `.env`, preventing `DisallowedHost` 400 errors when deployed behind a reverse proxy on a public domain
- Added `.dockerignore` so the host `.env` file is no longer baked into the Docker image; environment variables are now exclusively supplied at runtime via `env_file` in `docker-compose.yml`

### Added
- `ROADMAP.md` — public phased development plan covering Phases 0–11
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — first-contribution guide with quickstart, PR checklist, and project structure overview
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Contributor Covenant v2.1
- `SECURITY.md` — responsible disclosure process and self-hosting hardening checklist
- `NOTICE` — third-party license attributions for all backend and frontend dependencies
- GitHub Actions CI workflow: Ruff lint, Django system check + test suite, Docker build check
- GitHub issue templates: bug report, feature request, new connector proposal
- GitHub pull request template referencing CLAUDE.md governance rules
- Production deployment guide in README (reverse proxy, TLS, backups, custom tile server, Overpass endpoint)
- Screenshots placeholder section in README

### Added (initial prototype)

  `measures`, `goals`, `maps`, and `api`.
- Split settings (`base`, `development`, `production`) with GeoDjango,
  internationalization (German + English), and DRF configured.
- Tailwind CSS pipeline (pre-compiled, no runtime Node dependency).
- Workspace data model supporting arbitrary cities, municipalities, regions,
  and administrative units worldwide — path-based multi-tenancy via
  `/<workspace-slug>/` URLs.

- Data hub UI with per-workspace data source listing, test connection, and
  sync trigger (admin-token protected).
- Rule-based measures engine generating prioritized interventions from
  available datasets.
- Transparent scoring across nine dimensions (climate, safety, quality of
  life, social impact, feasibility, cost, visibility, political viability,
  goal alignment) with fully explained rationales and source links.
- Prioritization view with strategy presets (Quick Wins, Vision Zero,
  Maximum Climate Impact, Fair Citywide Distribution).
- Public shareable measure detail pages with evidence and score breakdown.
- Methodology pages (global + per-workspace) explaining every calculation.
- New workspace wizard for adding any city or municipality in three steps.
- Seed data for three demo workspaces: Leipzig (rich data), Musterstadt
  (small town, sparse data), and Muster-Landkreis (regional, empty profile).
- German and English locale files for all UI strings.
- Language switcher with path-based locale prefix (`/de/`, `/en/`).
