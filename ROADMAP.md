# OpenMobility OS — Roadmap

This document tracks the development phases of OpenMobility OS from the initial
prototype through to a full open-source release and beyond.

Every phase is independently deployable — `docker compose up --build` produces a
working platform at the end of each one.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what has already shipped.

## Post-MVP Phases (8+)

These features are **not in the MVP**, but the architecture is already prepared for them.

---

### 🚧 Phase 8 — Accidents as a First-Class Layer
> Full accident data with mode classification.

- [x] `accidents` layer kind with standardized property schema:
  ```json
  {
    "severity": "fatal|serious|minor",
    "date": "ISO-8601",
    "time_of_day": "morning|day|evening|night",
    "weather": "dry|wet|snow|fog|...",
    "involved_modes": ["pedestrian", "cyclist", "car", "truck", "bus", "motorbike", "scooter", "tram"],

    "street_category": "residential|main|highway|..."
  }
  ```
- [x] Admin filter UI: severity + involved-mode checkboxes on the map page
- [x] Map layer with severity color-coded circle markers (fatal=dark red, serious=orange, minor=yellow)
- [x] Extended `accident_hotspot` rule — weighted by severity (fatal×3, serious×2, minor×1)
      and generates a second VRU-specific measure when cyclist/pedestrian involvement is high

  - `green_areas` — parks, meadows, gardens (OSM `landuse=grass/park/meadow`, WFS)
  - `sealed_surfaces` — sealing data from aerial analysis or open datasets
  - `heat_corridors` — cold-air / fresh-air corridors (GeoJSON from climate assessments)
  - `water_bodies` — rivers, retention areas, rainwater management
- [ ] Standardized property schema:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "tree|green_area|sealed_surface|open_corridor|water_body|permeable_pavement",
    "canopy_area_m2": 12.5,
    "sealed_pct": 0.85,
